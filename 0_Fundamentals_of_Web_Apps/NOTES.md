# A - General Info

- The main focus of this course is single page applications implemented with ReactJS, supporting them with RESTful API and GraphQL web services implemented in Node.js.

# B - Fundamental of Web Apps

- First rule of Web Development, always keep the Developer Console Open.
- [] Chrome is not getting a `Content-Length` header in response.
- [] Chrome is annoyingly sending a GET request for favicon
- [] The console is Chrome is logging `cf3 nfgv ` after every response (for any website)

- In traditional web application, the browser is 'dumb' ie it only fetches HTML from the server where all the application logic resides.

- Event handlers are Callback functions which are fired when the event is triggered.

- In SPA style of creating web-application, websites do not fetch all their pages separately from a server. Instead they are made of only 1 HTML page from the server, the components of which are manipulated by the JS which is executed in the browser.

- Full stack web dev means focusing on all aspects of web dev - front end, back end and the server.
